## Climate Learning Programme
<span class="subheader">Imperial College Business School x CMA CGM - TANGRAM</span>

{% capture text_cma %}

This bespoke Executive Education programme was offered to CMA CGM employees at the TANGRAM facility in Marseille. Over 1000 attendees attended the programme over 18 cohorts.

We led the delivery of the Sustainable Shipping segment, offering an overview of the policy landscapes, technological initiatives to support decarbonisation. A deep dive is offered on operational measures that reduce emissions and improve operational efficiency.
