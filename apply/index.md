## Doctoral Admissions

##### How do you assess PhD applications?

Our evaluation of new applications is grounded in three key criteria:

1. Academic Excellence: Applicants must possess a degree with distinction in an engineering discipline.
2. English Language Proficiency: International applicants are expected to meet our specified minimum English language standards, as outlined [here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/apply/requirements/english/).
3. Research Interests Compatibility: Your research interests should closely match our current research focus and priorities.

##### What are your current research priority areas?

A non-exhaustive list of topics that we are currently interested in is as follows:

1. Autonomy in shipping and freight distribution
2. Cooperative control of autonomous vehicle swarms
3. Collaboration, coordination and competition of last-mile urban delivery

Our list of [recent papers](/papers/) might provide you with further ideas regarding potential research topics that are currently of interest to our group.

##### Where can I find information regarding TSL's academic requirements?

Please refer to [this page](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/apply/requirements/pgacademic/) for the minimum admission requirements used at Imperial College London. We expect successful candidates to possess a first-class Master's-level degree (or non-UK equivalent).

##### Do you have any scholarships? 

A variety of scholarships are available, and further information on key dates and eligibility requirements can be found at the following links:

- **College-wide scholarships** are listed [**here**](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/fees-and-funding/scholarships-search/).
- Scholarships offered by the **Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering** are advertised [**here**](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/civil-engineering/prospective-students/postgraduate-research-admissions-phd/department-scholarships/).
- Many of our researchers also receive funding through scholarship schemes from their home countries.

##### When should I submit my application?

Due to the limited number of PhD positions available in our group each year, we strongly encourage potential applicants to submit their applications as early as possible.

Additionally, if you wish to be considered for any internal scholarships, please consult the relevant pages for specific deadlines that may apply.

##### How should I structure my research statement?

Should you decide to proceed with an application, please make sure that you include a personal statement that is 2-3 pages long and follows the structure below: 

- A summary of the research topics that excite you.
- A section on your thoughts on how you endeavour to fill existing gaps in knowledge.
- Overview of your academic background, highlighting previous GPAs, awards, and graduation rank.
- Summary of any prior research outputs (i.e. dissertations, research placements). 
- Brief literature survey that covers recent developments in your area of interest.
